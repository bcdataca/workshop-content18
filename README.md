information, schedules and resources. The [full
schedule](http://workshop.bcdata.ca/2018/talk/full-schedule) has updated room
assignments.

This repository also contains a [resources](./resources.md) document for
individuals who might need a refresher on GitHub, scikit-learn, pandas, nltk,
tidyverse, dplyr or bash. The document also contains some project-specific
resources for loading and formatting particular file types (like genetic data);
and resources for running specific technical methods that might be useful in
solving the projects.

The computing Hub for this workshop is accessible to participants at
[bcdata.syzygy.ca](https://bcdata.syzygy.ca). Login requires a [GitHub
handle](https://github.com). Information on how to acquire this handle can be
found in the [resources document](./resources.md).
