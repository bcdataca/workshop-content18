# Interpolating ship paths in the Port of Metro Vancouver

**Hosted by:** SNC-Lavalin  
**Mentor:** Cameron Wallace  
**Project Room:** ORCH 3072

## Summary

As part of a study for the Port Authority of Vancouver, cargo ship positions
reported by their navigation systems were considered. These discrete positions
were pieced together into full ship routes which were then used to estimate the
amount and distribution of pollution generated by cargo traffic through the port
of Vancouver. In the original study, there was difficulty handling missing or
erroneous position data. This project is to improve the reconstruction process
of ship routes. Specifically, the problem is to look through the data to find
all the records for a particular ship over a ten day period, and:

1. generate a route map for the ship over that ten day period;
2. identify when there is bad data for the ship and correct it so that the
  resulting route map is as close as possible to what it should be;
3. for bonus marks, make sure the routes don’t go over land (find open data to
  describe the coastline in polygons, and incorporate it).

Alternatively, identify characteristics that might flag “good” data vs. “bad”
data (i.e. speed variations), and identify ways to systematically correct for
bad data without minimum variation of the route. Identify the number of trips
that would be caught and fixed with the methods.

Information on AIS data (and more AIS data!) is availble at the links below. In
particular, the Wikipedia contains a section describing the column names of the
data.

  for a description of the columns in the data.
* [aishub](http://www.aishub.net/stations): it's possible they have *more* data
  if necessary.

  possible they have historical AIS data available - especially and including
