# Determining intent and automating knowledge base creation from live chat transcripts

**Hosted by:** Comm100  
**Mentors:** David Carlson and Kevin Gao  
**Project Room:** ORCH 4062

## Summary

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is being dramatically enhanced by AI and
machine learning. We believe NLP is at the tipping point, about to reach a level
of performance accuracy that makes widespread commercial applications more
dependable. The challenge is in quickly training bots on common lexicon, intent,
and reaction. The data set provided includes thousands of online chat sessions
between support and sales agents of a company and their customers or online web
visitors. Each chat log includes [chat transcript, duration times, and customer
rating]. We’ve identified some business issues/use cases with suggested
solutions for you to solve but you are not limited to the following issues or
solutions (get creative! See things we don’t see in with the data that would
provide real business value):

1. Cluster or Correlate chat sessions:
   * Build an algorithm or methodology to cluster or correlate similar issues
     across chat sessions defined by you
2. We have a Knowledge Base (KB) tool but it is manual work on the client side
   to create Q&A’s. Is there a way to progress towards full automation in
   building a Knowledge Base with what’s already there?
   * Build a KB comprised of questions and their corresponding answers in an
     automated way.

The goal here is to see if the students can: a) figure out a mathematical model
for determining intent, and b) develop a tool that can be used to repeat that
process with new data sets.
